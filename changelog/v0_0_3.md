## v0.0.3
Added badge generator cli tool. Some helper utilities could be useful
in general:

   - `unittestmixins.AssertPrintsMixin`: unittest mixin to assert what a piece
     of code will print via a context manager method
     (similar to `assertRaises`)
   - `cli.main`: decorator for main functions of modules. This avoids the
     infamous pattern `if __name__ == "__main__:"`, that can be so
     cumbersome for unittests
