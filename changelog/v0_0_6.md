## v0.0.6
Refactored workflow and setup. Added more unittest mixins
   
   - `AssertDoesntRaiseMixin`: for asserting that a piece of code won't raise an
     exception
   - `SignificantPlacesAssertMixin`: for asserting equalities based on
     significant places and not absolute decimal places
   - `RMSEAssertMixin`: for asserting equalities based on the root-mean-squared
     error
